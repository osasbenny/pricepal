        <h1>PricePal Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: August 9, 2025</em></p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PricePal ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in a transparent manner. By using the PricePal App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>1.1. Information You Provide Directly</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bargaining Data:</strong> When you use PricePal to get price suggestions, you may input item names, prices, and other related details. This information is processed locally on your device to generate suggestions.</li>
            <li><strong>Saved Deals:</strong> If you choose to save final prices or deal records, this data is stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> Your preferred language (Pidgin or English) is stored locally on your device to enhance your user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>PricePal is designed to operate primarily offline and minimizes data collection. We do not automatically collect personal information such as your location, device identifiers, or usage patterns for analytics or advertising purposes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> The App utilizes built-in phrases and AI models that function without an internet connection. No data is transmitted during offline use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect primarily to provide and improve the PricePal App's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To generate AI-powered price suggestions based on your input.</li>
            <li>To enable you to save and track your bargaining history locally.</li>
            <li>To personalize your experience by applying your preferred language settings.</li>
            <li>To operate the App's offline features seamlessly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>PricePal does not share your personal information with third parties. All bargaining data, saved deals, and language preferences are processed and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, nor do we transmit it to any external servers.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of your information. Since PricePal primarily processes and stores data locally on your device, the security of your data largely depends on the security measures you have in place for your device (e.g., device password, encryption).</p>

        <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
        <p>As your data is stored locally, you have full control over it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Deletion:</strong> You can access and delete your saved deals directly within the App. Deleting the App from your device will remove all locally stored data.</li>
            <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> You can change your language preference at any time within the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PricePal is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
